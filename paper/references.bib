  abstract = {People often fall into learning traps where a false belief about the structure of the environment leads to under-exploration of rewarding options. Two studies (N = 324) examined whether observation of the approach decisions of another learner facilitated escape from a trap. After an initial learning phase in a task where approach of different category members could lead to gains or losses, we identified whether participants had learned an optimal two-dimensional categorization rule or fallen into the trap of using a one-dimensional rule. Participants then observed the approach decisions of another learner using the same or a different category rule. Participants' categorization rules in a final round of category learning were then assessed. A substantial proportion of those who had initially fallen into the trap shifted to the optimal rule after observing use of an alternate rule. This effect was found following observation of both optimal (Experiment 1) and sub-optimal rules (Experiment 2). In contrast, those who learned the optimal rule in the initial learning phase were unaffected by social observation. The results show that social learning is a viable approach for facilitating escape from learning traps.},

We present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world's alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We also present several ``visual Turing tests'' probing the model's creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior.},

DreamCoder solves both classic inductive programming tasks and creative tasks such as drawing pictures and building scenes. It rediscovers the basics of modern functional programming, vector algebra and classical physics, including Newton's and Coulomb's laws. Concepts are built compositionally from those learned earlier, yielding multi-layered symbolic representations that are interpretable and transferrable to new tasks, while still growing scalably and flexibly with experience.},

  abstract = {Instrumental learning involves corticostriatal circuitry and the dopaminergic system. This system is typically modeled in the reinforcement learning (RL) framework by incrementally accumulating reward values of states and actions. However, human learning also implicates prefrontal cortical mechanisms involved in higher level cognitive functions. The interaction of these systems remains poorly understood, and models of human behavior often ignore working memory (WM) and therefore incorrectly assign behavioral variance to the RL system. Here we designed a task that highlights the profound entanglement of these two processes, even in simple learning problems. By systematically varying the size of the learning problem and delay between stimulus repetitions, we separately extracted WM-specific effects of load and delay on learning. We propose a new computational model that accounts for the dynamic integration of RL and WM processes observed in subjects' behavior. Incorporating capacity-limited WM into the model allowed us to capture behavioral variance that could not be captured in a pure RL framework even if we (implausibly) allowed separate RL systems for each set size. The WM component also allowed for a more reasonable estimation of a single RL process. Finally, we report effects of two genetic polymorphisms having relative specificity for prefrontal and basal ganglia functions. Whereas the COMT gene coding for catechol-O-methyl transferase selectively influenced model estimates of WM capacity, the GPR6 gene coding for G-protein-coupled receptor 6 influenced the RL learning rate. Thus, this study allowed us to specify distinct influences of the high-level and low-level cognitive functions on instrumental learning, beyond the possibilities offered by simple RL models.},

  abstract = {Learning traps arise where early experience leads to a false belief about the reward structure of the environment which, in turn, leads to avoidance of rewarding options. Two experiments examined the role of ``summative'' feedback, which signals that a current decision rule is suboptimal, in reducing the prevalence of such traps. Participants learned to predict which category exemplars should be approached to obtain a reward and which should be avoided to prevent a loss. Those in a contingent-feedback only condition received outcome feedback on trials where they approached an exemplar, but not when it was avoided. In summative feedback conditions, this was supplemented by information that indicated the gap between current accumulated rewards and optimal earnings. A large proportion of those receiving only contingent feedback learned an incomplete categorization rule that led to suboptimal rewards. Similar results were obtained when summative feedback was infrequent. However, when multiple instances of summative feedback were presented during learning, there was an increase in the proportion of participants showing optimal rule-learning. Our results represent one of the first successful interventions for reducing the prevalence of learning traps.},

We found that selective social learning preserved rare discoveries of exceptional algorithms in a large experimental simulation of cultural evolution. Participants (N = 3450) faced a difficult sequential decision problem (sorting an unknown sequence of numbers) and transmitted solutions across 12 generations in 20 populations. Several known sorting algorithms were discovered. Complex algorithms persisted when participants could choose who to learn from but frequently became extinct in populations lacking this selection process, converging on highly transmissible lower-performance algorithms. These results provide experimental evidence for hypothesized links between sociality and cognitive function in humans.},

  abstract = {Research on stereotype formation has proposed a variety of reasons for how inaccurate stereotypes arise, focusing largely on accounts of motivation and cognitive efficiency. Here, we instead consider how stereotypes arise from basic processes of approach and avoidance in social learning. Across five studies, we show that initial negative interactions with some members of a group can cause subsequent avoidance of the entire group, and that this avoidance perpetuates stereotypes in two ways. First, when information gain is contingent on approaching the target, avoidance restricts the information available with which to update one's beliefs. Second, computational models that consider the perceiver's full reinforcement history demonstrate that avoidance directly reinforces itself, such that initial avoidance of group members increases the probability of later acts of avoidance toward that group. Finally, we find initial evidence for a potential dissociation between behavior and explicit beliefs, with avoidance reinforcing avoidant behaviors without necessarily affecting self-reported beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that avoidance behaviors toward members of social groups can perpetuate inaccurate negative beliefs and expectations about those groups, such that initial interactions with a group have a compounding effect on overall impressions.

  abstract = {Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents' actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. We propose a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents' behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states. This approach formalizes in precise probabilistic terms the essence of previous qualitative approaches to action understanding based on an ``intentional stance'' [Dennett, D. C. (1987). The intentional stance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] or a ``teleological stance'' [Gergely, G., N{\'a}dasdy, Z., Csibra, G., \& Bir{\'o}, S. (1995). Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age. Cognition, 56, 165--193]. In three psychophysical experiments using animated stimuli of agents moving in simple mazes, we assess how well different inverse planning models based on different goal priors can predict human goal inferences. The results provide quantitative evidence for an approximately rational inference mechanism in human goal inference within our simplified stimulus paradigm, and for the flexible nature of goal representations that human observers can adopt. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for human action understanding in real-world contexts, and suggest how our framework might be extended to capture other kinds of mental state inferences, such as inferences about beliefs, or inferring whether an entity is an intentional agent.},

Relevant evaluative reactions include beliefs, feelings, and behaviors toward the attitude object. Interactions between these reactions arise through direct causal influences (e.g., the belief that snakes are dangerous causes fear of snakes) and mechanisms that support evaluative consistency between related contents of evaluative reactions (e.g., people tend to align their belief that snakes are useful with their belief that snakes help maintain ecological balance). In the CAN model, the structure of attitude networks conforms to a small-world structure: evaluative reactions that are similar to each other form tight clusters, which are connected by a sparser set of ``shortcuts'' between them. We argue that the CAN model provides a realistic formalized measurement model of attitudes and therefore fills a crucial gap in the attitude literature. Furthermore, the CAN model provides testable predictions for the structure of attitudes and how they develop, remain stable, and change over time. Attitude strength is conceptualized in terms of the connectivity of attitude networks and we show that this provides a parsimonious account of the differences between strong and weak attitudes. We discuss the CAN model in relation to possible extensions, implication for the assessment of attitudes, and possibilities for further study.

Yet previous studies often assume identical payoffs between observer and demonstrator, overlooking the diversity of social information in real-world interactions. We address this gap by introducing a socially correlated bandit task that accommodates payoff differences among participants, allowing for the study of social learning under more realistic conditions. Our Social Generalization (SG) model, tested through evolutionary simulations and two online experiments, outperforms existing models by incorporating social information into the generalization process, but treating it as noisier than individual observations. Our findings suggest that human social learning is more flexible than previously believed, with the SG model indicating a potential resource-rational trade-off where social learning partially replaces individual exploration.

In this project, we explore this interaction between language and experiential learning through a novel sequential decision-making task, the "instructed bandit task" (IBT). In the IBT, agents make choices and receive rewards sampled from an unknown Gaussian distributions after being given linguistic hints. The IBT assesses how linguistic input and experienced reward values combine to determine choice behavior. We additionally propose a novel Bayesian reinforcement learning model that combines Bayesian updating from experience with propositional constraints that capture the meaning of the linguistic hints. As a point of comparison, we evaluate both human participants and Centaur, a LLaMA-based model fine-tuned to mimic human behavior, on the IBT. Our results show that all agents converge with the Bayesian model, and the granular difference in choice sequences reveal the varied role instruction plays in decision-making tasks.},

By combining experimental methods and computational modeling, the current study investigated the impact of two key factors believed to play essential roles in the development of a simple-rule learning trap: early learning experience and selective attention. Our results showed that, in a learning environment where the true category mapping was determined by conjunctions of two predictive dimensions, the likelihood of falling into a single-dimensional learning trap increased when early learning experience involved a large loss that could be predicted from a single feature dimension. In addition, using a model-based measurement of attention bias, we observed that early experience affected trap formation by narrowing the distribution of attention to exemplar features. These findings provide the first direct empirical evidence of how early learning experience shapes the formation of a simple-rule learning trap, as well as a more granular understanding of the role of selective attention and its interaction with early learning experience in trap formation.},

Across five experiments, we find no effect of incentive on rule discovery performance. However, in a sixth experiment requiring category recognition but not learning, we find a large effect of incentives on response time and a small effect on task performance. Participants appear to apply more effort in valuable contexts, but the effort is disproportionate with the performance improvement. Taken together, the results suggest that performance in tasks that require novel inductive insights is relatively immune to financial incentives, while tasks that require rote perseverance of a fixed strategy are more malleable.

Previous work on the negative effects of such traps has focused on static learning environments. The current work examines an additional negative effect of learning traps in dynamic environments---blindness to change in the features that predict decision outcomes. In two experiments (N = 416), participants had to decide whether to approach members of two different categories, respectively associated with either gains or losses. Early in learning, a category rule involving two feature dimensions predicted category membership. Subsequently, there was a change in the feature composition of this rule. When outcome feedback was only provided when an item was approached, a substantial proportion of participants fell into the trap of using a simple one-dimensional rule to guide approach decisions. Most of these participants did not notice the subsequent rule change and never learned the new rule. Signaling the possibility of rule change (Experiment 2) had no effect on change blindness for those in the learning trap but did improve learning of the new rule for those who initially avoided the trap.

A further set of intervention experiments provides causal evidence that reducing exploration cost can substantially mitigate even complex stereotypes.},

  abstract = {Cognitive control allows one to focus one's attention efficiently on relevant information while filtering out irrelevant information. This ability provides a means of rapid and effective learning, but using this control also brings risks. Importantly, useful information may be ignored and missed, and learners may fall into ``learning traps'' (e.g., learned inattention) wherein they fail to realize that what they ignore carries important information. Previous research has shown that adults may be more prone to such traps than young children, but the mechanisms underlying this difference are unclear. The current study used eye tracking to examine the role of attentional control during learning in succumbing to these learning traps. The participants, 4-year-old children and adults, completed a category learning task in which an unannounced switch occurred wherein the feature dimensions most relevant to correct categorization became irrelevant and formerly irrelevant dimensions became relevant. After the switch, adults were more likely than children to ignore the new highly relevant dimension and settle on a suboptimal categorization strategy. Furthermore, eye-tracking analyses reveal that greater attentional selectivity during learning (i.e., optimizing attention to focus only on the most relevant sources of information) predicted this tendency to miss important information later. Children's immature cognitive control, leading to broadly distributed attention, appears to protect children from this trap---although at the cost of less efficient and slower learning. These results demonstrate the double-edged sword of cognitive control and suggest that immature control may serve an adaptive function early in development.},

In particular, we investigate the role of directed interaction between pairs---such as wall posts, comments, and "likes"--- and consumption of friends' content, including status updates, photos, and friends' conversations with other friends. We find that directed communication is associated with greater feelings of bonding social capital and lower loneliness, but has only a modest relationship with bridging social capital, which is primarily related to overall friend network size. Surprisingly, users who consume greater levels of content report reduced bridging and bonding social capital and increased loneliness. Implications for designs to support well-being are discussed.},

Such propensities are characteristically attributed to individual, organizational, and cultural traits such as risk aversion, uncertainty-avoidance, discounting, and an unwillingness to change. This paper explores an alternative interpretation of such phenomena. We show how the reproduction of successful actions inherent in adaptive processes, such as learning and competitive selection and reproduction, results in a bias against alternatives that initially may appear to be worse than they actually are. In particular, learning and selection are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation, they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage in risky and new activities is increased. These protections against the error of rejecting potentially good alternatives on inadequate experiential evidence are costly, however. They increase the likelihood of persisting with alternatives that are poor in the long run as well as in the short run.},

Prior work has focused on the effect of perceived similarity between two individuals (self and others), such as the degree of overlap in past choices or explicitly recognizable group affiliations. In the real world, however, any dyadic relationship is part of a more complex social structure involving multiple social groups that are not directly observable. Here we suggest that human learners go beyond dyadic similarities in choice behaviors or explicit group memberships; they infer the structure of social influence by grouping individuals (including themselves) based on choices, and they use these groups to decide whose choices to follow. We propose a computational model that formalizes this idea, and we test the model predictions in a series of behavioral experiments. In Experiment 1, we reproduce a well-established finding that people's choices are more likely to be influenced by someone whose past choices are more similar to their own past choices, as predicted by our model as well as dyadic similarity models. In Experiments 2-5, we test a set of unique predictions of our model by looking at cases where the degree of choice overlap between individuals is equated, but their choices indicate a latent group structure. We then apply our model to prior empirical results on infants' understanding of others' preferences, presenting an alternative account of developmental changes. Finally, we discuss how our model relates to classical findings in the social influence literature and the theoretical implications of our model. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that structure learning is a powerful framework for explaining the influence of social information on decision making in a variety of contexts.},

Overcoming these limitations through social interaction is one of the most distinctive features of human intelligence. In this paper, we show that information accumulation in multigenerational social networks can be produced by a form of distributed Bayesian inference that allows individuals to benefit from the experience of previous generations while expending little cognitive effort. In doing so, we provide a criterion for assessing the rationality of a population that extends traditional analyses of the rationality of individuals. We tested the predictions of this analysis in two highly controlled behavioral experiments where the social transmission structure closely matched the assumptions of our model. Participants made decisions on simple categorization tasks that relied on and contributed to accumulated knowledge. Success required these microsocieties to accumulate information distributed across people and time. Our findings illustrate how in certain settings, distributed computation at the group level can pool information and resources, allowing limited individuals to perform effectively on complex tasks.},

Participants in a large behavioural experiment showed increased rates of biased decision-making when part of a social network relative to asocial participants in 40 independently evolving populations. Drawing on ideas from Bayesian statistics, we identify a simple adjustment to content-selection algorithms that is predicted to mitigate bias amplification by generating samples of perspectives from within an individual's network that are more representative of the wider population. In two large experiments, this strategy was effective at reducing bias amplification while maintaining the benefits of information sharing. Simulations show that this algorithm can also be effective in more complex networks.},

We compared our social inference model against simpler heuristics in three studies of human behaviour in a collective-sensing task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that average performance improved as a function of group size at a rate greater than predicted by heuristic models. Experiment 2 introduced artificial agents to evaluate how individuals selectively rely on social information. Experiment 3 generalized these findings to a more complex reward landscape.

In this paper, we present a computational account of the inference and integration process that underpins learning from a combination of social and direct evidence. This account formalizes the learner's intuitive understanding of psychology--- or theory of mind (ToM)---including attributes such as confidence, reliability, and knowledgeability. It then shows how ToM is the lens used to interpret another person's choices, weighing them against the learner's own direct evidence. To test this account, we develop an experimental paradigm that allows for graded manipulation of social and direct evidence, and for quantitative measurement of the learner's resulting beliefs. Four experiments test the predictions of the model, manipulating knowledgeability, confidence, and reliability of the social source. Learners' behavior is consistent with our quantitative and qualitative model predictions across all 4 experiments, demonstrating subtle interactions between evidence and the attributes of those learned from.},

Across two preregistered studies, four- to six-year-old US children (N = 136, 50\% female, mixed ethnicities, data collected 2020--2022) experienced either a disagreement or an agreement with a confederate about a causal mechanism after being presented with ambiguous evidence. We measured (1) children's confidence in their belief before and after the (dis)agreement, and (2) how long children searched for information about the correct answer. Disagreement, especially with an expert (Experiment 2), reduced overconfidence and prompted children to search longer for information, compared to agreement. Together, our findings suggest possibilities for interventions aimed at fostering humility and learning across the lifespan.},

  author = {Leonard, Julia A},
  abstract = {The ability to reason about our own and others' competence informs our everyday decisions. However, competence is an abstract concept which manifests in the objective properties of the task completed by an agent (i.e., task-based features, such as quality of outcome or task difficulty) as well as the subjective properties of the agent (i.e., agent-based features, such as dexterity, speed, focus). Thus, acquiring an integrated notion of competence may be a nontrivial challenge for young children. Prior work on children's understanding of competence has often used explicit verbal cues to describe the relevant features, or experimental tasks that confounded these features. Here we examine how preschool-aged children evaluate the relative competence of two agents by systematically manipulating task-based and agent-based features without explicit linguistic or gestural support. We find that 4- and 5year-olds readily use perceptual cues to task-based (i.e., task difficulty) and agent-based (i.e., agent speed) features to infer competence (Exp.1-3) but not when when these perceptual cues are closely matched (Exp.4). These results suggest that a basic understanding of relative competence emerges earlier than previously believed, but an abstract, adult-like concept of competence may continue to develop throughout childhood.},

In two experiments, we investigate the effect of outcome valence on learning trap development. Participants chose to approach or avoid category exemplars associated with rewards or losses, and, to maximize reward, must learn a categorization rule based on two stimulus dimensions. We replicate previous findings showing that when outcome feedback was contingent upon approaching exemplars, people frequently fell into the trap of using an incomplete categorization rule based on only a single dimension, which was suboptimal for long-term reward. Notably, learning trap development was attenuated in an environment with frequent loss outcomes, even when participants received explicit information about the base rates of gains and losses. The implications of these findings for theoretical models and future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Modeling human cognition is challenging because there are infinitely many mechanisms that can generate any given observation. Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resourcerational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind's most impressive cognitive skills with people's ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.},

We test whether exploration and learning change across development using a task that presents a ``learning trap.'' In this task, exploitation---maximizing immediate reward and avoiding costs---may lead the learner to draw incorrect conclusions, while exploration may lead to better learning but be more costly. In Studies 1, 2, and 3 we find that preschoolers and early school-aged children explore more than adults and learn the true structure of the environment better. Study 3 demonstrates that children explore more than adults even though they, like adults, predict that exploration will be costly, and it shows that exploration and learning are correlated. Study 4 shows that children's and adults' learning depends on the evidence they generate during exploration: children exposed to adult-like evidence learn like adults, and adults exposed to child-like evidence learn like children. Together, these studies support the idea that children may be more exploratory than adults, and this increased exploration influences learning.},

It examines some complications in allocating resources between the two, particularly those introduced by the distribution of costs and benefits across time and space, and the effects of ecological interaction. Two general situations involving the development and use of knowledge in organizations are modeled. The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run. The possibility that certain common organizational practices ameliorate that tendency is assessed.},

These strategies themselves are partly products of natural selection, making the study of social learning an inherently Darwinian project. Formal models of the evolution of social learning suggest that reliance on social learning should increase with task difficulty and decrease with the probability of environmental change. These models also make predictions about how individuals integrate information from multiple peers. We present the results of microsociety experiments designed to evaluate these predictions. The first experiment measures baseline individual learning strategy in a two-armed bandit environment with variation in task difficulty and temporal fluctuation in the payoffs of the options. Our second experiment addresses how people in the same environment use minimal social information from a single peer. Our third experiment expands on the second by allowing access to the behavior of several other individuals, permitting frequency-dependent strategies like conformity. In each of these experiments, we vary task difficulty and environmental fluctuation. We present several candidate strategies and compute the expected payoffs to each in our experimental environment. We then fit to the data the different models of the use of social information and identify the best-fitting model via model comparison techniques. We find substantial evidence of both conformist and nonconformist social learning and compare our results to theoretical expectations.},

In the real world, however, possible search spaces are often so large that decision makers are incapable of covering all options, even if they pool their information collectively. One strategy to handle such overload is developing generalizable knowledge that extends to multiple related environments (``across-task'' learning). However, it is unknown whether and how social information may facilitate such across-task learning. Here, we investigated participants' social learning processes across multiple laboratory foraging sessions in spatially correlated reward landscapes that were generated according to a common rule. The results showed that paired participants were able to improve efficiency in information search across sessions more than solo participants. Computational analysis of participants' choice-behaviors revealed that such improvement across sessions was related to better understanding of the common generative rule. Rule understanding was correlated within a pair, suggesting that social interaction is a key to the improvement of across-task learning.},

  abstract = {While there is no doubt that social signals affect human reinforcement learning, there is still no consensus about how this process is computationally implemented. To address this issue, we compared three psychologically plausible hypotheses about the algorithmic implementation of imitation in reinforcement learning. The first hypothesis, decision biasing (DB), postulates that imitation consists in transiently biasing the learner's action selection without affecting their value function. According to the second hypothesis, model-based imitation (MB), the learner infers the demonstrator's value function through inverse reinforcement learning and uses it to bias action selection. Finally, according to the third hypothesis, value shaping (VS), the demonstrator's actions directly affect the learner's value function. We tested these three hypotheses in 2 experiments (N = 24 and N = 44) featuring a new variant of a social reinforcement learning task. We show through model comparison and model simulation that VS provides the best explanation of learner's behavior. Results replicated in a third independent experiment featuring a larger cohort and a different design (N = 302). In our experiments, we also manipulated the quality of the demonstrators' choices and found that learners were able to adapt their imitation rate, so that only skilled demonstrators were imitated. We proposed and tested an efficient meta-learning process to account for this effect, where imitation is regulated by the agreement between the learner and the demonstrator. In sum, our findings provide new insights and perspectives on the computational mechanisms underlying adaptive imitation in human reinforcement learning.},

We find that observing the exploration behavior of an optimally choosing partner was detrimental to participants' overall performance and reduced participants' exploratory tendencies. In contrast, observing a random partner's exploration behavior stimulated participants' exploration, though this increase in exploration did not help participants to uncover the reward function. Following previous literature, a reinforcement learning model that contained eligibility traces was able to describe human behavior and helped to uncover potential mechanisms that could explain aspects of the findings.},

Advice from an artificial teacher was presented in 60\% of the trials, allowing us to compare choice behavior with and without advice. Results showed a strong and reliable tendency to follow advice (test-retest reliability {\textasciitilde}0.73). Computational modeling suggested a unique contribution of three distinct learning strategies: (a) individual learning (i.e., learning the value of actions, independent of advice), (b) informed advice-taking (i.e., learning the value of following advice), and (c) non-informed advice-taking (i.e., a constant bias to follow advice regardless of outcome history). Comparing artificial and empirical data provided specific behavioral regression signatures to both informed and non-informed advice taking processes.

We examined the patterns of human social learning through an interactive online experiment with 699 participants, varying both task uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical Bayesian model fitting to identify the individual learning strategies exhibited by participants. Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity among individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of herding among large groups confronted with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social learning of small groups, and the greater probability that social information would be accurate for less-challenging tasks, generated 'wisdom of the crowd' effects in other circumstances. Our model-based approach provides evidence that the likelihood of collective intelligence versus herding can be predicted, resolving a long-standing puzzle in the literature.},

  abstract = {Why groups of individuals sometimes exhibit collective `wisdom' and other times maladaptive `herding' is an enduring conundrum. Here we show that this apparent conflict is regulated by the social learning strategies deployed. We examined the patterns of human social learning through an interactive online experiment with 699 participants, varying both task uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical Bayesian model fitting to identify the individual learning strategies exhibited by participants. Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity among individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of herding among large groups confronted with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social learning of small groups, and the greater probability that social information would be accurate for less-challenging tasks, generated `wisdom of the crowd' effects in other circumstances. Our model-based approach provides evidence that the likelihood of collective intelligence versus herding can be predicted, resolving a long-standing puzzle in the literature.},

  abstract = {When making decisions, humans can observe many kinds of information about others' activities, but their effects on performance are not well understood. We investigated social learning strategies using a simple problem-solving task in which participants search a complex space, and each can view and imitate others' solutions. Results showed that participants combined multiple sources of information to guide learning, including payoffs of peers' solutions, popularity of solution elements among peers, similarity of peers' solutions to their own, and relative payoffs from individual exploration. Furthermore, performance was positively associated with imitation rates at both the individual and group levels. When peers' payoffs were hidden, popularity and similarity biases reversed, participants searched more broadly and randomly, and both quality and equity of exploration suffered. We conclude that when peers' solutions can be effectively compared, imitation does not simply permit scrounging, but it can also facilitate propagation of good solutions for further cumulative exploration.},

  abstract = {Humans are remarkably effective social learners, with several recent studies formalizing this capacity using computational models. However, previous research has often been limited to tasks where observer and demonstrator share the same reward function. In contrast, humans can learn from others who have different preferences, skills, or goals. To study social learning under individual differences, we introduce the socially correlated bandit, where participants have personalized rewards, which are correlated with but not identical to those of others. Social information can still be useful, but not when used verbatim. We present a model of Social Generalization that integrates individual and social information into the generalization process, but assumes social information to be noisier and thus less informative. This model out-competes previous models, with it being the dominant strategy in evolutionary simulations. Our findings expand on previous models of social learning, showing humans can integrate social information more flexibly than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {People often rely on social learning---learning by observing others' actions and outcomes---to form preferences in advance of their own direct experiences. Although typically adaptive, we investigated whether social learning may also contribute to the formation and spread of prejudice. In six experiments (n = 1550), we demonstrate that by merely observing interactions between a prejudiced actor and social group members, observers acquired the prejudices of the actor. Moreover, observers were unaware of the actors' bias, misattributing their acquired group preferences to the behavior of group members, despite identical behavior between groups. Computational modeling revealed that this effect was due to value shaping, whereby one's preferences are shaped by another's actions toward a target, in addition to the target's reward feedback. These findings identify social learning as a potent mechanism of prejudice formation that operates implicitly and supports the transmission of intergroup bias.},

  abstract = {Learning traps are cycles of suboptimal decision-making where a false belief about the structure of the environment leads to avoidance of rewarding options. Two experiments (N= 324) examined the role of selective attention in the emergence and prevention of learning traps. Participants learned to approach or avoid members of two categories that were associated with either gains or losses. A rule involving two visual feature dimensions predicted category membership, while a third dimension was irrelevant. Category feedback was provided only when an item was approached. Selective attention during learning was assessed using an eye tracker. Experiment 1 found that many participants fell into the trap of using a single-dimension rule to guide approach/avoid decisions and consequently missed rewards. Eye tracking confirmed that these participants narrowed their visual attention to a single dimension. In Experiment 2, we manipulated visual feature salience across three groups and found evidence for a causal role of selective attention in determining the emergence and prevalence of learning traps.},
