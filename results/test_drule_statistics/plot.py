Plot for Test Decision Rule Statistics

TODO: Create a stacked bar plot showing decision rule usage across datasets and conditions.

Design specification:
- For each dataset, show 4 stacked bars side by side:
  1. First test phase (all participants) 
  2. Second test phase - trapped learners in asocial condition (control)
  3. Second test phase - trapped learners with 2D partners
  4. Second test phase - trapped learners with other-1D partners

- Each stacked bar shows proportions of:
  - 2D rule (orange/C1)
  - 1D rule (blue/C0) 
  - Neither rule (white)

- Include:
  - Sample sizes below each bar
  - Significance indicators (*, **, ***) above social condition bars
  - Clear labeling for conditions
  - Legend showing rule types
  - Professional styling suitable for publication

Data sources:
- outputs/first_test_drule_statistics.csv
- outputs/second_test_drule_statistics.csv

Output formats:
- SVG and PDF for publication
