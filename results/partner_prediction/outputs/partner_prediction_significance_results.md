# Partner Prediction Performance and Learning Outcomes: Statistical Analysis

Generated: 2025-09-09 16:25:42

## Overview

This analysis examines whether partner rule inference success predicts subsequent learning outcomes for trapped learners in **dataset 5** (participants who used 1D rules in the first test phase). Dataset 5 is the only dataset with a partner prediction phase, allowing analysis of the relationship between partner inference ability and learning outcomes. Partner prediction performance was categorized using a threshold of ≥15 correct predictions in the final partner prediction block (phase 2, block 3).

### Sample Sizes (Dataset 5 Only)

- **Total participants in dataset 5**: 192
- **Trapped learners in dataset 5 (1D first test)**: 90
- **High prediction performers (≥15 correct)**: 85
- **Low prediction performers (<15 correct)**: 107
- **Trapped high performers**: 54
- **Trapped low performers**: 36

## Methods

- **High performers**: ≥15 correct partner predictions in final block
- **Low performers**: <15 correct partner predictions in final block
- **Statistical test**: Permutation tests (10,000 iterations)
- **Significance levels**: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001

## Key Findings

### Statistically Significant Differences (p < 0.05)

- **Informative Partners (2D + Other-1D) - 2D Rule**: High performers had higher rates (79.3% vs 22.2%, p=0.0000)
- **Informative Partners (2D + Other-1D) - 1D Rule**: High performers had lower rates (17.2% vs 75.0%, p=0.0000)
- **Optimal Partners (2D) - 2D Rule**: High performers had higher rates (94.7% vs 28.0%, p=0.0000)
- **Optimal Partners (2D) - 1D Rule**: High performers had lower rates (0.0% vs 68.0%, p=0.0000)

## Interpretation

These results provide evidence that partner rule inference ability predicts subsequent learning outcomes. Participants who were better at predicting their partner's choices showed different patterns of learning in the second test phase.
